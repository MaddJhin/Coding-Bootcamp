Things To Do Before an Interview
    Research the company
        google alert news

Initial Questions:

    1 Tell Me About Yourself (This should be read as Why should I hire you? What do you bring to this position from your past experience and education?)
    2 What are your career goals? (Think about this question as a way to tell an employer how you would perform as a developer and be realistic about where you are at in your career right now.) 
    3 Tell me about your web development experience and what qualities you possess that help you in this role.

    Think about best fit
        Two way street - how do you fit with the company and how does the company fit with you.
        Help them to picture me working there

    Interview the interviewer
        Not general question
        Look at mission, motto
        Show that you know them and the position

    Add ancillary skills to pitch so that a title doesn't box you in
    Demonstrate commitment to the craft (I've been doing it for a while so it's not a phase)

    Remember body language
    Confident speaking - Direct but not forceful

    Note: Certificate not certification

Situational Question:

    1 Tell us about a time that you came upon a challenge on a recent project or with a coworker.
    2 What role do you typically play in a team?
    3 What led you to coding?
