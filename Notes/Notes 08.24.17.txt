Notes 08.24.17:

DOM Manipulaiton

    It's possible to directly write into elements. 
    If <tags></tags> are added, it will add the tag.


    Global variables = tied to the window object


JQuery

    css selecter (also known as an x path)
    JQuery by default support chaining
    It must be loaded
        Error message when not loaded "$ is not defined"
    

    Ready Function
    $(document).ready(function(){
            
        })

    Always wrap Jquery in ready function. It waits for the DOM to be ready to look for elements
    Only Exeption: functions that you want to call in console.log()
