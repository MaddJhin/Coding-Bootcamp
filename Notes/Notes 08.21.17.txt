JavaScript

Datatypes
    Only three types:
        Bolean
        Number
        String

    Types can be compared to each other and converted with "="

    Best Practice: When comparing vars using == put variable second
        Example: Do: if(13 == number) Never: if(number == 13)
        This is done so that you do not accidentally overide a variable 
        by using only "=".  
        Called the Joda condition

    Triple Equal (===) compares type and value. 

    In java, stings take presedence over math. To sum numbers, it is necessary to parseint().
