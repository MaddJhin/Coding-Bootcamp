Declarations

    Functions
        function myFunction (){

        }

        var myFunction = function(){

        }

        var myFunction = () =>{
            
        }

    variable Declarations

        const
            will trow an error if a var is redeclared with same name 

            Example (this would trow an error)
                const something = 0;
                var something = 1;                    


        let = does not bind to this
            great to use inside loops
