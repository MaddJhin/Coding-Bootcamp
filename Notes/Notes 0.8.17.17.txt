Notes 08.17.17:

Diference between sections and div: nothing, purely semantic


Container example

    <header>
    <nav>
    <sections>    
    <article>
    <aside>
    <footer>
    <details>
    <summary>

Features
    canisue.com allows to figure out if we can use elements in code across different browsers without adding backwards compatability. 
    If higher than 95% then there is no problem.

    Classes are applied across multiple instances, but IDs are unique and should never repeat. 

Content Deliver Network CDN

    Bootstrap is a CDN.
